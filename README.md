# File Handling in Python

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating file handling operations:

- `file.py` : Reads content from `sample.txt` and prints it line by line.
- `Append.py` : Writes user input to `output.txt`, appends more input, and prints the final content.
- `sample.txt` : A sample text file used in `file.py`.
- `output.txt` : Stores user input from `Append.py`.
